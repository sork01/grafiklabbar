We added support for camera pitch by extending the camera code from lab 2 with the standard
matrix for rotation about the x-axis which is then multiplied with the matrix used for the
y-axis. We do not allow the camera heading to be affected by the pitch.

We added support for controlling the camera pitch and yaw using the mouse, using the suggested
SDL_GetRelativeMouseState. This was fairly straightforward except for an issue where this
function returned very large readings immediately at the start of the program. We fixed this
by ignoring the mouse during the first 500 ticks (by SDL_GetTicks) of runtime.
