We implemented the simplest possible form of backface culling by skipping any triangles
where the angle between the surface normal of the triangle and a vector from the triangle
to the camera position exceeds 90 degrees. Since we don't take the camera heading and FOV
into account we are not able to cull triangles that are behind the camera.
