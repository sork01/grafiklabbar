To fix the issue with vertices being behind the camera we added a form of ''fake'' clipping
by looking at the camera space z-coordinates of triangle vertices and skipping the entire
triangle as soon as any vertex is found located at z < 1. This is not a good solution since it
causes triangles to ''pop out of existence'' when one or more of its vertices ends up
too close to the camera, but we believe it is better than nothing.
